# CampRobot
The Makerspace of the University of La Verne held a online robotics camp over Webex in which we taught kids how to create a robot using the Arduino with the Ulatrasonic Sensor and IR Sensor. The robot is controlled by an Arduino/Arduino motor shield with a 3-D printed frame. It runs on two DC motors which are controlled with the AFMotor.h library using the motor shield. The Ultrasonic sensor is facing forward and the IR sensor is facing backward. They both control when the robot moves. If either sensors detect an object then the robot will stop and move in the opposite direction. Thus if the robot had a wall in front of it and in back of it, the robot would move back and forth betweeen.
